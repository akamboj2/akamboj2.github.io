            <b>Abstract:</b>
            <br><br>
            Agriculture is facing a labor crisis, leading to increased interest in fleets of small, under-canopy robots (agbots) that can perform precise, targeted actions (e.g., crop scouting, weeding, fertilization), while being supervised by human operators remotely. 
            However, farmers are not necessarily experts in robotics technology and will not adopt technologies that add to their workload or do not provide an immediate payoff.
            In this work, we explore methods for communication between a remote human operator and multiple agbots and examine the impact of audio communication on the operator's preferences and productivity.
            We develop a simulation platform where agbots are deployed across a field, randomly encounter failures, and call for help from the operator. 
            As the agbots report errors, various audio communication mechanisms are tested to convey which robot failed and what type of failure occurs. 
            The human is tasked with verbally diagnosing the failure while completing a secondary task. 
            A user study was conducted to test three audio communication methods: earcons, single-phrase commands, and full sentence communication. 
            Each user completed a survey to determine each method's overall effectiveness and preferences. 
            Our results suggest that the system using short phrases is the most positively perceived by participants and may allow for the human to complete the secondary task more efficiently.

        This was a Machine Learning final project we completed, involving labeling and running a semantic segmentation task for building classification through resnet CNNs.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
        <br><br>
        Abstractâ€”There are currently a very diverse range of building
        materials and construction styles used in cities throughout the
        world. Being able to track these materials and methods in
        buildings is important as it determines the procedures for
        rehabilitation and repairs. In order to determine the make of
        a building, recent data about the buildings is needed which is
        not always readily available. Identifying each building, if not
        automatized, would require an enormous amount of manpower.
        We hope to automatize this task, providing a framework capable
        of fetching images of buildings from Google Street-View and
        classifying them.
